## Usage

`fetcher.py -user USERNAME -repo REPOSITORY [-token TOKEN] [-maketargets MAKETARGET1 MAKETARGET2 ...]` to check the status of pull requests on a particular repository you have access to. Requires an elephant file with a github auth token in to be set (alternatively, this can be passed as an argument).

Should only be used on private repos where only trusted persons have access.
